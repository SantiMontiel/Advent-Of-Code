# 🎄🐍 Advent of Code 2023 in Python

This year I will be making Advent of Code in Python (as usual) and then I will
"translate" my solutions to [Rust](https://github.com/santimontiel/advent-of-code-rs).

## ⌛ Execution times

In this Table you can find the execution times of each Python solution.
These times are obtained with the `summary` decorator in every solution.
If there is a refactor or further versions of the solution, the time is in parenthesis:

| Part 1              | Part 2                |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| 0.973 ms (1.534 ms) | 57.231 ms (49.759 ms) |
| 0.442 ms            | 0.552 ms              |
| 16.416 ms           | 50.829 ms             |
