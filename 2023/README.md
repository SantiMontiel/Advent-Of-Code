# üéÑüêç Advent of Code 2023 in Python

This year I will be making Advent of Code in Python (as usual) and then I will
"translate" my solutions to [Rust](https://github.com/santimontiel/advent-of-code-rs).

## ‚åõ Execution times

In this Table you can find the execution times of each Python solution.
These times are obtained with the `summary` decorator in every solution.
If there is a refactor or further versions of the solution, the time is in parenthesis:
